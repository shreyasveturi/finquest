    "## 🧠 I. PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY — What Scio Is\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scio** (\"I know\" in Latin) is a minimalist, AI-powered learning platform that turns finance news into real understanding — preparing users for interviews and real-world thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The product **must** be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classy** — Refined, sophisticated aesthetic\n",
    "- **Minimalist** — Every pixel serves a purpose\n",
    "- **Fast** — Instant feedback, no friction\n",
    "- **Calm** — No FOMO, streaks, or notification spam\n",
    "- **Intelligent** — AI-powered but not overbearing\n",
    "- **Focused on learning, not dopamine** — No gamification fluff\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every feature must contribute to actual, deep comprehension.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> If it doesn't help a user understand something more deeply — do not implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Scio Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Takes real finance content (articles, news)\n",
    "2. Activates learning with structured interaction\n",
    "3. Produces real understanding\n",
    "4. Builds real interview-ready skill\n",
    "\n",
    "Scio's job is **understanding**, not engagement metrics."

    "## 🚀 II. THE CORE LEARNING LOOP\n",
    "\n",
    "All product design and features must follow this **4-step pedagogical loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: **Prediction** 🎯\n",
    "**Before reading**, users write a hypothesis about what the article will discuss or what outcome they predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activated via `<PredictionCard />`\n",
    "- Users record their thinking before any content exposure\n",
    "- Builds metacognitive awareness\n",
    "- Analytics: `trackPredictionWritten()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: **Interactive Reading** 📖\n",
    "Users read the article with multiple layers of **active learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inline explanations for jargon\n",
    "- `<InsightBox />` components for key concepts\n",
    "- Improved tooltips (definition + example + interview relevance)\n",
    "- `<InteractiveCheckpoint />` for real-time comprehension checks\n",
    "- Highlight-to-explain AI feature for deep dives\n",
    "- Ensures \"passive reading → active understanding\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: **Reflection** 💭\n",
    "After reading, users **rewrite a concept in their own words** using `<ReflectionCard />`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forces deep encoding\n",
    "- Surfaces misconceptions\n",
    "- Creates retrievable memory\n",
    "- Analytics: `trackReflectionWritten()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: **Mastery** 🏆\n",
    "XP rewards are **tied to learning quality**, not streaks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checkpoint correct → +10 XP\n",
    "- Prediction + reflection → +5 XP each\n",
    "- Displayed subtly, not loudly gamified\n",
    "- Reinforces the learning loop, not engagement loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Loop Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction** activates prior knowledge and curiosity\n",
    "2. **Reading** provides new information with scaffolding\n",
    "3. **Reflection** cements understanding through production\n",
    "4. **Mastery** validates correct reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts passive consumption into active construction of knowledge."

    "- **Font family**: Clean sans-serif (system stack or Inter)\n",
    "- **Headings**: `text-3xl font-semibold` (max 3xl, never larger)\n",

    "## 🎯 IX. LEARNING FIRST MANIFESTO — The North Star\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is the Core Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> **If a feature does not directly help a user understand something more deeply — do not implement it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the law. All features must serve learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ DO Build\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text selection → AI explanation (active learning)\n",
    "- Prediction cards (metacognition)\n",
    "- Reflection prompts (encoding)\n",
    "- Interactive checkpoints (verification)\n",
    "- Inline tooltips (just-in-time learning)\n",
    "- Analytics on comprehension (insight, not tracking)\n",
    "- Clean, minimalist UI (reduces cognitive load)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ DON'T Build\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gamification fluff (streaks, badges, confetti)\n",
    "- Social features (leaderboards, sharing)\n",
    "- Unnecessary notifications (FOMO tactics)\n",
    "- Marketing widgets (social proof, testimonials)\n",
    "- Excessive animations (distraction)\n",
    "- Noisy analytics (personal data collection)\n",
    "- Algorithm-driven recommendations (engagement loop)\n",
    "- Ad integrations (conflicts with learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Over Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engagement metrics reward addiction, not learning.**\n",
    "- A user who spends 10 minutes understanding one concept deeply is better than a user who spends 2 hours skimming.\n",
    "- XP should validate learning quality, not time spent.\n",
    "- Analytics should be invisible to users — they're for us, not for showing off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Trade-Off\n",
    "\n",
    "Scio will not grow as fast as dopamine-driven competitors. **That's the point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users will not return out of FOMO.\n",
    "- Users will not grind for streaks.\n",
    "- Users will not feel addicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead:\n",
    "- Users will return because they're building real skill.\n",
    "- Users will feel calm and focused, not stressed.\n",
    "- Users will recommend Scio because it actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're unsure whether to add a feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ask: Does this help the user learn?**\n",
    "   - If no → don't build it.\n",
    "   - If yes → continue to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ask: Is this the simplest way to achieve learning?**\n",
    "   - If no → simplify it.\n",
    "   - If yes → continue to step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ask: Does this align with minimalist design?**\n",
    "   - If no → redesign it.\n",
    "   - If yes → build it.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The User Promise\n",
    "\n",
    "When users come to Scio, they should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity** — No jargon, no fluff, just clear explanations\n",
    "- **Respect** — No FOMO, no addiction loops, no dark patterns\n",
